Cloud Server Technical Control Requirements,"Version 1.4
For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to inform the University community of the technical security control requirements for Internet-exposed cloud servers owned and managed by the University, which meet specific criteria enumerated below.
Scope
This IT policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.
Policy Statement
Security controls may be in the form of an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Security Management Tools (SMT) for all Internet-exposed cloud servers regardless of the service provider (e.g., Microsoft™ Azure, Amazon™ AWS) if the business partner requires one or more of the elements listed below.
As technology changes, these security controls may change, or other methods may be implemented. 
There will likely be costs associated with the implementation of security controls.
IT and business partners must be aware of these potential costs and adjust their budgets.
IT and business partners must accept the cost associated with the selected level of service.
The control requirements and risk evaluations involving the Office of Information Technology’s Information Security and Assurance, DevOps - Platform Services, DevOps - Application Services, or Educational Technologies, and the business partners are outlined in the table below:

*Fordham Sensitive Data is the default data classification and should be assumed when there is no information indicating the data should be classified as protected or public. See the Data Classification Guidelines.
Definitions
Fordham Protected Data is any data that contains personally identifiable information concerning any individual, as well as any data that contains personally identifiable information that is regulated by local, state, or federal privacy regulations, and any data designated or described by any voluntary industry standards or best practices concerning the protection of personally identifiable information that Fordham chooses to follow. See the Data Classification Guidelines.
Fordham Sensitive Data is based on departmental/internal standard operating procedures (e.g., budgets, payroll, or properties that Fordham may be interested in purchasing). See the Data Classification Guidelines. 
High Availability refers to systems that are durable and likely to operate continuously without failure. The term implies that parts of a system have been thoroughly tested and, in many cases, that there are accommodations for failure in the form of redundant components.
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a form of access control. Its intent is not only to detect a network attack but also to prevent it. It neither requires nor involves human intervention to respond to a system attack.
IT Resources include computing, networking, communications, applications, telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and any related materials and services.
Operational risk summarizes the uncertainties and hazards Fordham University faces when it attempts to do its day-to-day business activities.
Reputational Risk refers to the potential for negative publicity, public perception, or uncontrollable events that may damage Fordham University’s reputation, and thereby may affect its revenue, accreditation, current enrollment, or future enrollment.
Security Management Tool (SMT) is a tool provided by the cloud platform that analyzes, assesses the security of the cloud service continuously, and offers immediate feedback on potential security risks. These tools are cloud-specific (e.g., Azure Security Center for Microsoft Azure, Inspector for Amazon Web Services).
Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a system or service that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a website to protect it from attack.

Data Classification and Protection,"Version 3.0
For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for classifying institutional data based on its level of sensitivity, value, and criticality to the University. Classification will aid in determining baseline security controls for the protection of data. 
Scope
This IT policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the ""User(s)"" or ""you"") who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University's IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.
Policy Statement
All University data must be classified into one of three classifications after the creation or acceptance of ownership by the University: Fordham Protected Data, Fordham Sensitive Data, or Public Data. 
Data classification will aid in determining security controls for the protection and use of data to ensure:
The University's statutory, regulatory, legal, contractual, and privacy obligations are met,
Government and regulatory agency reporting is conducted per any legislative, regulatory, and legal requirements,
The University's proprietary data is protected as required,
Data is appropriately available for decision-making as required, and
Relevant data and information are shared (including third parties) with the necessary safeguards.
If data is created jointly by more than one department, all involved departments must cooperatively classify the data. If the departments are unable to agree on the classification, the data is classified as Fordham Sensitive Data and remains designated as Fordham Sensitive Data until the Data Owners reach an agreement to reclassify the data or until administrators (e.g., Data Standards Committee, area Vice Presidents) with authority adjusts the classification.
Data owners must assess the level of risk according to the probability that harm will occur and the extent of that harm should the data be lost, stolen, or accessed by unauthorized parties.
Departments are responsible for implementing appropriate managerial, operational, physical, and technical controls for access to, use of, transmission of, and disposal of University data in compliance with this and related policies. 
Definitions
Data Classification, in the context of information security, is the classification of data based on its level of sensitivity and the impact on the University should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.
Data Owner(s) are responsible for the information, security, and use of a particular set of information. 
Fordham Protected Data is any data that contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Personal Data concerning any individual. Fordham Protected data includes data regulated by local, state, Federal, the European Union (EU), or other statutes/agreements. These regulations may include, but are not limited to:
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS)
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security Act (SHIELD Act)
Fordham Protected Data is also designated or described by voluntary industry standards or best practices concerning protecting such data that the University chooses to follow.
Fordham Sensitive Data is based on departmental/internal standard operating procedures (e.g., budgets, payroll, or properties that Fordham may be interested in purchasing).
IT Resources include computing, networking, communications, application, telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and related materials and services.
Personal Data is any information relating to a natural person (data subject) that can directly or indirectly identify that person. Examples include a name, an identification number, location data (e.g., mailing address, IP address), an online identifier (e.g., cookies), or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person. The GDPR does not apply to data rendered anonymous (individuals cannot be identified from the data) or pseudonymous (provided that the ""key"" that enables the re‑identification of individuals is kept separate and secure).
Personally Identifiable Information is information about an individual maintained by an agency, including any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date, and place of birth, mother's maiden name, any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information, driver's license number or non-driver identification card number, account number, credit, or debit card number in combination with other identifiable data, biometric information such as a fingerprint, voice print, retina or iris image, or other unique physical representation or digital representation, and username or email address in combination with a password or security question.
Public Data may be disclosed to any person regardless of affiliation with the University. It is data that does not contain PII or Personal Data concerning any individual, not Fordham Protected data or Fordham Sensitive data.

Definitions
Authentication is used when the server needs to identify who is accessing the information or site. Authentication does not determine what tasks the individual can do or what files the individual can view.
Authorization is a process by which a server determines if the individual has permission to use a resource or access a file. Authorization is usually coupled with authentication so the server can identify the individual requesting access.
Encryption involves the process of transforming data so that it is unreadable by anyone who does not have a decryption key. Encryption in transit means ensuring that all data sent over a network is encrypted.
IT Resources include computing, networking, communications, application, and telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and related materials and services.

Disk Encryption,"Version 2.2
For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni
Purpose
This policy establishes requirements for using disk encryption technologies on the University’s IT Resources to protect the confidentiality of information.
Scope
This IT policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the Fordham IT staff (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.
Policy Statement
IT Resources, such as laptops, desktops, and servers, are required to employ Full Disk Encryption. In addition, all databases and backups must be encrypted. 
You are required to employ encryption for all Fordham Sensitive and Fordham Protected data regardless of the medium (e.g., USB storage device, external hard drive, cloud storage). 
Users may obtain encryption software from Information Security and Assurance (ISA) or use other ISA-approved encryption software. 
Users must not attempt to disable, remove, or otherwise tamper with the encryption software. 
When traveling, some countries have encryption import and use restrictions. Check with the U.S. Department of State before traveling with encrypted IT Resources internationally to ensure that you have the most up-to-date information, or consult with the ISA if you have questions. 
Many nations do not recognize a personal use exemption1.
Before traveling to these countries with an encrypted laptop, you may need to apply to their specified governmental agency for an import license.
Additional information about international encryption controls and personal use exemption can be found at the following websites:
The Wassenaar Arrangement
Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce - Export Administration Regulations.
1Several countries negotiated rules to facilitate traveling with encryption software known as the Wassenaar Arrangement. One provision allows a traveler to freely enter a participating country with an encrypted device under a personal use exemption as long as the traveler does not create, enhance, share, sell or otherwise distribute the encryption technology while visiting.
Definitions
Encryption involves the process of transforming data so that it is unreadable by anyone who does not have a decryption key.
Full Disk Encryption (FDE), also known as whole disk encryption, is the process of encrypting all the data on the hard drive(s) on a computer, including the computer’s OS, and permitting access to the data only after successful authentication to the FDE product.
IT Resources include computing, networking, communications, application, and telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and any related materials and services.

Procedure Statement
Initial Policy Development 
A director (or higher) who wishes to develop a policy contacts the Senior Director of IT Security and Assurance (herein Director) to request a policy.
The requestor may create a policy draft and send it to the Director or summarize what they are trying to accomplish.
The Director has an analyst draft a policy for review.
The Director shares an initial draft if provided, with the analyst for edits.
The Director sends the requestor a draft developed by the analyst to confirm the drafted policy captures the essence of what is required by the policy.
The Director, working with the requestor, identifies areas impacted by the policy within IT.
The Director coordinates with the directors of the impacted areas and with the requestor to gather feedback on the proposed policy and incorporate changes, provided the changes do not undermine the requirements of the policy.
Once all feedback (e.g., requestor, business partners, departments) is incorporated, the Director has the analyst issue the final draft. This final draft includes the author and review frequency.
The analyst sends the draft to the AVP/CISO for review.
The AVP/CISO shares the draft with the CIO for review prior to sharing with the S-Team for feedback. If there are edits, the analyst incorporates them and sends them back for review.
If the policy requires Legal Counsel approval, the Director sends the draft to the Office of Legal Counsel for their approval. If there are edits, the analyst incorporates them and sends them back for review.
Once the updated policy is approved, the analyst publishes the latest version of the policy to the IT Security Policy Library on the University's website. 
Policy Review 
One month before policy expiration, the analyst sends a notification via email informing the responsible parties that the policy needs to be reviewed.
If the responsible parties deem no changes are required, they will respond in writing that no changes are necessary, and the Director or analyst will note that no further action is required.
The analyst notes the policy was reviewed in the revision history section.
In the absence of a responsible party, the Director identifies the appropriate person to review the policy.
In the absence of the Director, the AVP/CISO identifies the appropriate person to review the policy.
If the policy requires revision, it must follow the Policy Revision section's steps below.
Policy Revision 
The responsible parties who wish to modify their policy contacts the Director to request the latest version of their policy.
The requestor may modify their policy and send it to the Director or summarize what they are trying to accomplish and have the analyst draft an update for review.
The Director shares an updated draft with the analyst for edits if provided.
The Director sends the requestor updates to confirm the policy has captured the essence of what is being modified.
The Director, working with the requestor, identifies areas impacted by the policy within IT based on the changes made.
The analyst calls a meeting with the directors of the impacted areas and with the requestor to gather feedback on the proposed policy and incorporate changes, provided the changes do not undermine the requirements of the policy.
Once all feedback is incorporated, the Director has the analyst issue the final draft.
Depending on the significance of changes made to the policy, the draft is sent to the AVP/CISO for review or approval.
If the revision to the policy is not approved, the Director works with the requestor to resolve issues and gain approval.

Once the updated policy is approved, the analyst publishes the latest version of the policy to the IT Security Policy Library on the University's website.
Service Level
Because of the nature of the development of policies and the coordination of impacted areas, it should be expected that initial policy development and policy revisions may take 30 business days from start to finish. The policy review occurs one calendar month before policy expiration. If a modification to a policy is required, the policy revision begins at the time the Director is notified of the fact that changes are to be made, not at the time the policy review commenced.

Vulnerability Management,"Version 2.1
For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests
Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to delineate the steps involved in IT vulnerability management in accordance with the Vulnerability Management Policy. It ensures the utilization of suitable tools and methodologies to evaluate vulnerabilities within systems or applications and facilitate remediation.
Scope
This IT document and all policies referenced herein shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrators, staff, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.
Procedure Steps
The steps in the vulnerability management procedure ensure a systematic approach to identifying, prioritizing, planning for, addressing, and validating the resolution of vulnerabilities within IT systems and applications.
Discovery Phase:  Identify vulnerabilities present within IT Resources.
Prioritization Phase: Discovered vulnerabilities and assets are reviewed, prioritized, and assessed using results from technical and risk reports.
Planning Phase: Devise comprehensive mitigation strategies and action plans to address identified vulnerabilities.
Remediation Phase:  Implement necessary measures to address and rectify vulnerabilities identified during the discovery phase.
Validation Phase:  Conduct subsequent analysis to determine the effectiveness of the remediation measures deployed.
Discovery Phase
Utilize tools such as BitSight, Burp Suite, Invicti (formerly Netsparker), Nmap, Qualys, and WPScan to identify vulnerabilities on IT Resources.1
Prioritization Phase
Application and system owners review and prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity levels and risk assessments. Prioritization Criteria:
Address confirmed severity levels 5, 4, or 3 findings in Qualys.
Prioritize vulnerabilities with a Qualys TruRisk Score of 700 or higher (High or Severe).
Attend to BitSight Bad Grade, Asset Importance High/Critical, and Finding Severity Material/Severe.
Address all severity levels findings in Invicti (formerly Netsparker) (Critical, High, Medium).
Include content security policy configurations, application header configurations, or certificate configuration findings in the prioritization process.
Seek guidance from Information Security and Assurance in case of conflicting severity levels.
Planning Phase
Remediation for the vulnerability findings should be mitigated and validated within the following time frame from initial discovery (i.e., first detected date of vulnerability on respective IT Resources):
Within 30 Days
All BitSight findings graded as Bad
Qualys confirmed severity levels 5 and 4
Confirmed Qualys severity levels 5, 4, and 3 on all systems within the PCI Network
Invicti (formerly Netsparker) Critical and High Severity Levels
Within 60 Days
Qualys confirmed Severity Level 3
Remaining Invicti (formerly Netsparker) Medium and Low severity levels
The ISA may identify findings that are not directly in line with the assessment tools mentioned above and may need to be addressed outside the noted days mentioned.
Remediation Phase
System and application owners must undertake one or more of the following, including but not limited to:
Mitigating controls with ISA approval.
Patches deployment.
Configuration changes deployment.
System upgrades.
Removal/discontinuation of IT Resources usage.
Validation Phase
Verify the effectiveness of remediation efforts through thorough analysis and validation.
Ensure that vulnerabilities are successfully addressed and no longer pose a threat.
Address any discrepancies between remediation actions and validation results.
Escalate unresolved issues or false positives to the Information Security and Assurance team for further investigation and resolution.
Verify the vulnerability no longer exists based on finding the source (e.g., assessment tool, ad hoc finding).
If remediation has taken place, and the change is not reflected in a validation scan or deemed not applicable (e.g., if mitigating controls were implemented, vulnerability is a false positive), the application or system owner is responsible for letting the Information Security and Assurance know via email at infosec@fordham.edu
1Depending on the nature of an OS or application deployed, Information Security and Assurance may leverage alternative assessment tools or methodologies to determine vulnerabilities.
Definitions
IT Resources include computing, networking, communications, application, and telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and any related materials and services.
A patch is a software update comprised of code inserted (i.e., patched) into the code of an executable program. Typically, a patch is installed into an existing software program. Patches are often temporary fixes between full releases of a software package. Patches include, but are not limited to, the following:
Upgrading software

Web Application Security Deployment,"Version 1.2
For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests
Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to deploy web application security controls on the University’s IT Resources.
Scope
This IT procedure, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the Office of Information Technology staff (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.
Procedure Statement
System/application owners are responsible for deploying appropriate Web Application Security controls1 to protect web applications per the Web Application IT Security Policy. This document provides the steps necessary to administer web application security controls and policies for all incoming traffic to the University’s web applications to filter out malicious visitors and requests (e.g., SQL injections, XSS attacks, cookie poisoning, denial-of-service attacks, brute force, credential stuffing).2
A. Authentication
Verify that hard-coded credentials are not stored within the application code.
Enable password reset where Central Authentication Service (CAS) cannot be implemented:
Reset system passwords with challenging questions and answers.
Password reset options must not reveal the validity of the account.
Passwords must meet the University’s password requirements as stated in the Acceptable Uses of IT Infrastructure and Resources-Policy Statement.
Lock failed account logins after five failed attempts, and accounts must be locked for a minimum of five minutes.
Authentication error messages must be generic and not disclose any sensitive information regarding the account, such as the validity of the username or password.
Database credentials (i.e., the authentication credentials in the business logic tier) must be stored in a secure, centralized location on the server outside of the web root. The file should only be readable by the user account running the application.
Configure applications and middleware services to run with minimal privileges.
The application must automatically log out the inactive User after 15 minutes unless an extended session is approved by design and accepted by an Office of Information Technology AVP.
You must destroy corresponding data and session information on the server when the User logs out of the application.
The logout button or link must be easily accessible to the User on every page after they have authenticated.
B. Controlled Administrative Privileges
Use access control checks to mediate all requests to a standard security gateway (i.e., Mandatory Access Control), ensuring that access control checks are triggered whether or not the User is authenticated.
All decisions must be based on the principle of least privilege.
Grant access to newly created accounts on a need-to-know basis.
Do not allow direct object references to files or parameters that can be manipulated to grant access to the system.
Prevent non-validated forwards/redirects from unauthorized access and phishing by conducting access control checks before sending the User to the location.
C. Configuration and Operations
Office of Information Technology’s change management process must be followed so that new software releases are tested and associated documentation is completed before going live.
Configure the hardening of all infrastructure/application components to satisfy the agreed-upon levels of the vulnerability scanning tools.
Draft and regularly test a thorough disaster recovery plan to minimize the impact of an incident.
D. Data Protection
Disable HTTP access for all SSL-enabled resources.
Disable weak SSL ciphers.
Use valid SSL certificates from a reputable certificate authority.
Use the Strict-Transport-Security header to ensure that the browser does not talk to the server on non-SSL per the Server Certificate Security policy.
If database User passwords must be stored (e.g., files), appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs) must be used.
Perform critical establishment or exchanges over a secure channel (e.g., password manager, shared drive).
Securely store keys and make them accessible to the appropriate individuals on a need-to-know basis.
When appropriate, disable browser data caching using the cache control HTTP headers or Meta tags within the HTML page.
Turn off the autocomplete setting for sensitive inputs (e.g., login form in the HTML form).
E. Error Handling and Logging
Error messages must be generic and not reveal details about the application.
Suppress default framework error messages or replace them with customized messages.
Configure error handlers to handle unexpected errors without allowing unhandled exceptions to occur.
Logging and storage
All authentication activities, whether successful or not, must be logged, as well as privilege changes and administrative activities.
All-access to sensitive data such as PII or PHI must be logged and stored centrally in the University’s log management solution (e.g., SumoLogic).
Log retention must follow the retention policy set forth by the University to meet regulatory requirements per the Records Retention and Disposal Policy and the Logging Standards Policy.
F. Input and Output Handling
Contextual output encoding
All input functions must contextually encode data on the server side before the application accepts it.
Set the encoding using HTTP headers or Meta tags for every page in the application to ensure the page’s encoding is defined, and the browser does not have to determine the encoding on its own.
Allow lists/block lists
Allow listing input is the preferred approach; only accept data that meets the criteria.
Apply to block lists for known harmful input patterns and characteristics for more flexibility.
SQL Injection
Must be addressed during application development or as a last resort using a web application firewall to mitigate.
Create SQL queries with User content passed into a bind variable to prevent attacks.
Do not dynamically create SQL queries using string concatenation if the SQL query string is used in a bound or parameterized query.
Tokens for forged requests
Whenever possible, embed a random value unknown to third parties into the HTML form to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
Require a unique, sever-issued, and randomized token for each request.
G. File/Input Validation
Validate the size of the file, the file type, and the file contents (i.e., allow list, allowed file types, antivirus software, renaming files after uploading) when accepting file uploads from the User, and ensure that it is not possible to overwrite the destination path for the file.
Validate that the source of the input is the authenticated User.
H. Secure Cookie Attributes
The session cookie must be set with both the HTTP only and the secure flags.
Set the cookie domain and path scope to the most restrictive settings for the application.
Do not use wildcard domain-scoped cookies.
Session cookies must have a reasonable session expiration time.
Avoid non-expiring session cookies.

Definitions
Cookie Poisoning is the modification of a cookie (personal information on a web User's computer) by an attacker to gain unauthorized information about the User for purposes such as identity theft. The attacker may use the information to open new accounts or to gain access to the User's existing accounts.
Credential Stuffing is the automated injection of breached username/password pairs to gain access to User accounts fraudulently. This is a subset of the brute force attack category: large numbers of spilled credentials are automatically entered into websites until they are potentially matched to an existing account, which the attacker can then hijack for their purposes.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end-user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a User within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.
Denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack where the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended Users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting the services of a host connected to the internet.
IT Resources include computing, networking, communications, application, and telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and any related materials and services.
SQL Injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g., to dump the database contents to the attacker).
Web Application Security is a branch of information security that deals specifically with the security of websites, web applications, and web services.

Backup Policy,"Version 2.0
For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to maintain data integrity and availability of the University's IT Resources, to prevent data loss within the limits of record retention requirements, and to facilitate the restoration of the IT Resources and business processes.
Scope 
This IT policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the ""User(s)"" or ""you"") who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University's IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.
Policy Statement
System Owners must perform system state backups1 to support the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
System state backups must be retained for no less than 90 days and no more than one year unless otherwise stated in the Records Retention and Disposal Policy
Annually, System Owner(s) must test restore system state backups.
No less than 1% of IT Resources must be validated by the defined RPO and RTO.
Audited IT Resources are selected randomly.
Application Owner(s) or Business Analyst(s) with specific knowledge of the IT Resource should request all other types of backups (i.e., pertaining to business requirements) per the Backup Requests Procedure.
Application Owner(s) or Business Analyst(s) must ensure backups meet the Records Retention and Disposal Policy, business, and research requirements.
Backup inventories must be maintained by the System Owner(s).
1 System state backups save or copy information onto digital storage media to restore the server or system to a functioning state.
Definitions
Application Owner is the individual or group responsible for ensuring all the services that comprise an application accomplish the specified objective or set of user requirements. If a third party provides these services, the Application Owner is responsible for maintaining the relationships with the third party providing the service.
Backup is saving or copying information onto digital storage media.
IT Resources include computing, networking, communications, application, telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and related materials and services.
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. It is the age of the files or data in backup storage required to resume normal operations if a computer system or network failure occurs.
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum desired length of time allowed between an unexpected failure or disaster and the resumption of normal operations and service levels. The RTO defines the point in time after a failure or disaster at which the consequences of the interruption become unacceptable.
Restore/restoration is performed to return data that has been lost, stolen, or damaged to its original condition or to move data to a new location.

For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all changes to University IT Resources minimize any potential negative impact on services and Users.
Scope
This IT policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrative officials, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.
Policy Statement
All University IT Resources changes must be documented per the Change Control Process.
All changes to University IT Resources must follow the Change Control Process to ensure appropriate approval, planning, and execution.
Change requests may not be required for non-production (e.g., DEV, Test, QA) environments unless there is a significant upgrade or an impact.
Production change requests must note that the change has been successfully applied, tested, and verified in a non-production environment when a suitable environment(s) exists.
Changes to production environments undergo impact examination before submitting the change request per the Change Control Process. This information will be used to determine the impact of the change by considering:
The impact the proposed change will have on business services if it is expected to cause a widespread outage, a loss of connectivity, or functionality to a specific group or groups.
The risk involved by not making the change;
The risk if the change does not go as planned; and
Predictability of the success of the change.
Changes must be vetted for security implications through Information Security and Assurance participation.
Significant User experience changes must be conveyed to the Change Control Board and communicated to the affected audience and IT Service Desk.
A lessons learned session should occur in the event of an incident during a change request.
Definitions
Change Control is a systematic approach to managing all changes to University IT Resources. The purpose is to ensure that no unnecessary changes are made, that all changes are documented, that services are not unnecessarily disrupted, and that resources are used efficiently.
IT Resources include computing, networking, communications, application, and telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and related materials and services.
